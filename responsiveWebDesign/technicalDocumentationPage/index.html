      <p class="normal-text">Websites, single-page applications, internet portals, and various others are all common
        terms describing one particular technology. Presenting content and interactivity for a purpose. There are a
        multitude of ways this can be accomplished, but the majority of these are focused on 4 core coding languages
        applied in specific contexts to build a responsive web application. These languages are HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        and TypeScript.</p>
      <p class="normal-text">Each of these has its primary purpose and all of them are utilized in some of the most
        common web development toolsets, frameworks, and libraries. Angular and React are possibly the two most popular
        frameworks in use today. The beauty of what they do is simplify the foundational elements of web development
        into a concise package, allowing developers to create web applications without expert-level familiarity with the
        core languages.</p>
      <p class="normal-text">However, these core languages are the building blocks of web content. So, anyone who has a
        full and in-depth knowledge of these core languages, their purpose, scope, and applicability is not only capable
        of developing exceptional web applications. They are capable of fluidly shifting across frameworks and tools
        with the retained ability to create dynamic expert-level web content. These developers are the most sought-after
        technicians in their field.</p>
      <p class="normal-text">To better understand these languages, we will use an analogy throughout this document. That
        analogy is children's building blocks. Think of a fully formed web application as a completed castle made of
        children’s building blocks. Various aspects of the blocks themselves, their visual appearance, and a variety of
        interactive behaviors all have to be defined for the castle to look and be as intended. Web applications are no
        different.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="HTML">
      <header class="header">HTML</header>
      <p class="normal-text">Hypertext Markup Language forms all of the constructs that you see and interact with on
        most web pages. Think of this as the physical characteristics of the blocks as they exist. Each block requires a
        declaration to exist. Elements on a webpage are declared by the HTML for that page. For those of you who have
        coded before and are thinking, what about when you use another language to interactively duplicate elements, you
        must remember the scope of each language. The scope of HTML is to define the elements presented to the user. So
        even when other languages are used to duplicate elements and change them, if you were to examine the code behind
        the webpage, you would find that every element has its own specific HTML representation.</p>
      <p class="code-caption">Sample HTML:</p>
      <code
        calss="code">&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a simple paragraph in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="CSS">
      <header class="header">CSS</header>
      <p>Cascading Style Sheets or CSS, are what control how the elements are displayed. Every characteristic you see
        and some you don’t, is defined by CSS. The list of capabilities for CSS is far too long to mention here but a
        few of the most common are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li id="css-size">Size</li>
        <li id="css-color"><span>C</span><span>o</span><span>l</span><span>o</span><span>r</span><span>s</span></li>
        <li id="css-border">Borders</li>
        <li id="css-background">Backgrounds</li>
        <li id="css-font">Fonts</li>
        <li id="css-shape">Shapes</li>
        <li id="css-position">Positioning</li>
        <li id="css-animate">Animation/Transformation</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="code-caption">Sample CSS:</p>
      <code class="code">.class-name {width: 450px;}</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript">
      <header class="header">JavaScript</header>
      <p class="normal-text">JavaScript, commonly shortened as JS, is a programming and scripting language that allows
        client-side behaviors and interactivity to be loaded as a part of the webpage. Using the blocks example, rather
        than having to go somewhere to get another block of a certain size, shape, or color, imagine that just touching
        the block would cause it to change. Touching the top of a tower of blocks might result in a portion of the
        castle opening. These types of interactive behaviors are most often achieved by implementing JavaScript.</p>
      <p class="normal-text">Along with these dynamic behaviors, JavaScript is capable of producing entire webpages, by
        generating the HTML and CSS on the fly. It can manage calls from the client to the server and parse the
        responses. The possibilities are veritably endless.</p>
        <p class="code-caption">Sample JavaScript:</p>
        <code>sampleFunction(input) = alert(“this is your message:” + input);
          samplefunction(“hello World”);
          </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="TypeScript">
      <header class="header">TypeScript</header>
      <p class="normal-text"></p>
      <p>TypeScript, commonly represented as TS, is a little different in its scope than these other three languages.
        TypeScript is a type-emphasized code language that is compiled and the compiled result produces the various
        components of an application. Looking back at our blocks, think of the set of instructions that might come with
        the blocks. It defines what where when and how to put things where they belong so the castle is formed once
        complete. In the same way, TypeScript can be used to provide the specific instructions to a compiler which will
        then produce the required elements that a browser would then utilize to present the web application to you.</p>
        <p class="code-caption">Sample TypeScript:</p>
        <code>function myfunction(input: string):void {
          const message: string = "this is your message: ";
          alert(message.concat(input));
          return;
        }</code>
      <p class="normal-text">You may notice that this sample looks remarkably similar to the JavaScript example. The
        reason for that is both JavaScript and TypeScript are based on ECMAScript concepts. TypeScript requires
        compilation before it can be used by a browser to present an application, but it is also better at producing
        cross-browser-compatible components because of its emphasis on typing.</p>
